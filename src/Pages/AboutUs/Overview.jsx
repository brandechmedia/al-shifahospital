            a single day, despite the social scare. During Covid, we maintained

            <strong>Clinical Genetics:</strong> It is the application of advances
            in genetic medicine to the real-world. It involves diagnosis, care &
            counseling concerning options available to affected individuals & their
            family members. Genetic disorders include:
