            Interventional radiology (IR) is a medical specialty that uses minimally invasive techniques,
            guided by medical imaging such as X-rays, CT scans, or ultrasound, to diagnose and treat a wide
            range of conditions throughout the body. Here are some common uses of interventional radiology:

          <li>
            <strong>Angiography and Angioplasty:</strong> Used to diagnose and treat conditions affecting
            blood vessels by injecting contrast dye into blood vessels to visualize them on X-ray images.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Embolization:</strong> Blocks blood flow to specific areas of the body to treat abnormal
            blood vessels or stop bleeding.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Biopsies and Drainage:</strong> Obtains tissue samples or removes fluid buildup from
            various organs using minimally invasive techniques.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tumor Ablation:</strong> Destroys tumors without the need for surgery using methods
            like radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation, or cryoablation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Vascular Interventions:</strong> Includes EVLT, TACE, angioplasty/stenting, and
            management of DVT and arterial thrombosis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Vertebroplasty and Kyphoplasty:</strong> Injections of bone cement into fractured vertebrae
            to stabilize them and relieve pain.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Percutaneous Image-Guided Therapies:</strong> Minimally invasive treatments for conditions
            such as uterine fibroids, varicose veins, and prostate enlargement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Intravascular Foreign Body Retrieval:</strong> Removal of broken catheters or medical
            devices without open surgery.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Portal Hypertension Management:</strong> Redirection of blood flow to relieve pressure
            in the liver.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pain Management:</strong> Certain IR procedures can help alleviate chronic pain.
