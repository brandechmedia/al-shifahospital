            Advanced Hysteroscopy
          </h2>
          <p>
            Hysteroscopy is a procedure that provides a way for the Doctor to look inside the uterus. A hysteroscope is a tube with a light and a camera on the end. This scope is inserted into the cervix and then through the vagina. A doctor will use the hysteroscope to look for anything abnormal and can even take samples from the uterine wall to test for factors that will help diagnose or treat uterine problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hysteroscopy is a minor, outpatient surgery that can be performed with local, regional, or general anaesthesia. Sometimes no anaesthesia is needed. There is little risk to risk involved with this procedure for most women.

          There Are Two Kinds Of Hysteroscopy: Diagnostic And Operative.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Diagnostic hysteroscopy is commonly performed on women who are experiencing heavy menstrual periods and severe cramping or may be ordered if your doctor needs to know more about your reproductive health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Operative hysteroscopy can be used to correct various uterine conditions. Operative hysteroscopy is used to correct abnormalities that were detected during a diagnostic hysteroscopy. Hysteroscopy can be used to remove uterine polyps and fibroids, locate and remove bands of uterine scar tissue called adhesions, determine whether a septum (a malformation of the uterus from birth) is present, and help identify the cause of abnormal bleeding.
